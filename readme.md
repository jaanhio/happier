# Happier

### Summary
I don't think anyone would really say no to being happier. If I asked you right now if you're happy, you could give me a good feel of it. But if I ask you what has made you happy over the past year or so, you may find it much harder to recall what exactly made you happy. Furthermore, it's even harder to know whether you will enjoy a new activity or not.

**And that is the basis for Happier.** It's an app that records what you enjoy doing and predicts what you may like. There are 2 modes - **Journal** mode for end of day reflections, and **Experiencing** mode for 'in the moment' checks.

### What to tell Happier
Happier will ask you 3 questions:

#### 1. What did you do today? (Journal) / What you're doing right now? (Experiencing)
Free-text

#### 2. How happy did/do you feel doing it?
Scale of 1 to 5

#### 3. Tags (optional). The more tags you put, the faster we understand you and recommend you useful things!
Free-text, comma separated.

### What you get from Happier
Once every week/month/year/bespoke period, you get a customised report telling you how happy you were overall, the top 3 activities that made you the most/least happy, and recommends what activities you should try doing, based on your profile similarity with other users.

### What happens behind the scenes
Your data is fed into 2 machine learning models to profile and classify your activity. Like all machine learning models, the more data(activity ratings) you feed it, the better it gets at knowing and helping you.

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Your activities are converted into a form (embeddings) that can be understood and grouped by our algorithms via NLP.

#### Collaborative Filtering (CF)
CF takes the converted activities and your rating and builds up a profile for you and the acitivities. When generating a report, it ranks what will likely make you the happiest, and suggests them to you.
