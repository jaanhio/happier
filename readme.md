# Happier

### Summary
I don't think anyone would really say no to being happier. If I asked you right now if you're happy, you could give me a good feel of it. But if I ask you what has made you happy over the past year or so, you may find it much harder to recall what exactly made you happy. Furthermore, it's even harder to know whether you will enjoy a new activity. 

**And that is the reason for creating Happier.** It's an app that records what you enjoy doing and predicts what you may like. There are 2 modes - **Journal** mode for end of day reflections, and **Experiencing** mode for in the moment checks.

### What to tell Happier
Happier will ask you 3 questions:

#### 1. What did you do today? (Journal) / What you're doing right now? (Experiencing)
Free-text

#### 2. Who did you do it with? (J) / Who are you doing it with? (E)
+ Colleague(s)
+ Family
+ Friends
+ Solo
+ Choose from contact list

#### 3. How happy did/do you feel doing it?
Scale of 1 to 5


### What you get from Happier
Once every week/month/year, you will get a customised report telling you how happy you were overall, the top 3 activities that made you the most/least happy, and recommends what activities you should try doing, based on your profile similarity with other users.

### What happens behind the scenes
Your data is fed into 2 machine learning models to profile and classify your activity.

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Your activities are converted into a form that can be understood and sorted by our algorithms via NLP

#### Collaborative Filtering (CF)
CF takes the converted activities and what you rate them and builds up both a profile for the activity and you. When generating a report, it ranks what will likely make you the happiest, and suggests them to you.
