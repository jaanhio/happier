# happier

### Summary
I don't think anyone would really say no to being happier. If I asked you right now if you're happy, you could give me a good feel of it. But if I ask you what has made you happy over the past year or so, you may find it much harder to pinpoint what exactly made you happy. Furthermore, it's even harder to know whether you will enjoy a new activity. 

**And that is the reason for creating Happier.** It's an app that records what you enjoy doing and predicts what you may like.

### What to tell Happier
The interface is straightforward - you are asked what are you doing right now, and how happy do you feel: 

#### What you're doing right now?
There are 5 broad categories: 
+ School
+ Work
+ Family/Friends
+ Solo
+ Others

#### How happy do you feel?
Scale of 1 to 5

#### Tell us briefly what you are doing
Free-text

### What you get from Happier
Once every week/month/year, you will get a customised report telling you how happy you were overall, the top 3 activities that made you the most/least happy, and recommends what activities you should try doing, based on your profile similarity with other users.
